    abstract = {{Image registration finds a variety of applications in
computer vision. Unfortunately, traditional image registration
techniques tend to be costly. We present a new image
registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity
gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of
Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because
it examines far fewer potential matches between the images
than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration
technique can be generalized to...}},
